          <strong>Preamble</strong>
        </text>
        <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to promote the traditional value that children are the most important asset of the Tribe, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(h)">Article V, § 1 (h) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</cite> empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "engage in any business that will further the social or economic well-being of members of the Band or undertake any programs or projects designed for the economic advancement of the people" and pursuant to <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(j)">Article V, §1(j)</cite> "to administer any funds within  the control of the Band; to make expenditures from available funds for public purposes…All expenditures by the Governing Board shall be in accord with a previously approved budget, and the amount so paid shall be a matter of public record at all times." As such the Tribal Governing Board adopts this Ordinance to memorialize and confirm existing procedures used in the administration of general welfare assistance programs and services and is not to be construed as the creation of new general welfare assistance rights that previously did not exist. Assistance provided prior to the enactment of this Ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed as general welfare assistance pursuant to the authority of the Tribal Constitution. It is intended to establish a framework to improve the coordination of general welfare doctrine compliance. Programs and Services referred to herein must be authorized by independent action of the Tribe or its designees.</text>

            <heading>Authority</heading>
            <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(h)">Article V, § 1 (h)</cite> and (j) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "engage in any business that will further the social or economic well-being of members of the Band or undertake any programs or projects designed for the economic advancement of the people" and pursuant to <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(j)">Article V, §1(j)</cite> "to administer any funds within  the control of the Band; to make expenditures from available funds for public purposes…All expenditures by the Governing Board shall be in accord with a previously approved budget, and the amount so paid shall be a matter of public record at all times." On September 18, 2014, the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 passed both houses of Congress, and was signed into law on September 29, 2014. The Tribal Governing Board now expressly embraces the forgoing principles as an integral part of this Ordinance and as guiding principles in construing the Tribe's compliance with Code Section 139E, the Safe Harbor Rules, and the General Test. The assistance payments and services authorized by this Ordinance are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the general welfare doctrine to the fullest extent permitted by law and shall be construed accordingly.</text>

            <text>Programs that do not qualify for non-taxable treatment under Code Section 139E or under an IRS Safe Harbor, will nonetheless be treated as non-taxable if Program benefits meet the General Test for treatment under the General Welfare Exclusion.

            <text>Individual Needs. Certain Programs may be based on individual need, rather than an overall need of the Tribe. For those Programs, the Tribal Governing Board may establish income guidelines unique to the Tribe or may use readily available income guidelines used by state or federal programs to demonstrate individual or family need. When individual or family need must be shown, the Program may take into account individual circumstances or extraordinary need to overcome presumptions based on income alone.</text>

            <text>Certain Programs may be based on community needs, which are so important to the self-determination, culture and traditions of the Tribe that Assistance may be deemed necessary regardless of individual income or wealth. For example, states provide public education to all citizens regardless of individual income or wealth. Some Programs may address both individual and community-based needs. The Tribal Governing Board reserves the right to require any applicant applying for consideration based on non-financial or community-based needs to demonstrate how the Program benefits will benefit the tribal community as a whole, including preservation of culture, tradition and self-determination. Approval based on non-financial need criteria is made on a facts and circumstances basis and will be guided by traditional values and culture. A Program will be deemed to be based on community or non-financial needs if so designated by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

            <heading>Purpose of the Program</heading>
            <text>All Assistance disbursed pursuant to this Ordinance shall be designed to promote the general welfare, self-determination, culture and tradition of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board shall establish objectives for the furtherance of the general welfare, self-determination, culture and tradition of the Tribe and assess progress on said objectives in connection with its budgeting and/or strategic planning process. Approved Programs shall be renewed, established, modified, or terminated based upon the needs of the Tribe as compared to the objectives set by the Tribal Governing Board from time to time hereunder. All Programs hereunder shall provide a social benefit for the promotion of the general welfare of the Band and be limited to purposes consistent with treatment under this Ordinance. Such purposes may include, for example, and not by way of limitation, assistance for medical care, food, shelter, health, education, subsistence, housing, elder and disabled care, assistance to meet cultural, traditional and religious needs of the Tribe and its membership, and assistance to promote self-sufficiency, self-determination, Tribal image, entrepreneurship, and the employment of Tribal Members. Designation by the Tribal Governing Board if a Program as falling under this Ordinance shall be conclusive evidence that the Tribal Governing Board, following a good faith review of Tribal needs and goals, has determined that said Program is established to achieve a social benefit and to promote the general welfare of the Tribe.</text>

            <heading>Eligibility and Application Procedures</heading>
            <text>Each approved Program shall set forth the specific eligibility rules and limitations applied to that Program. Each designated department shall present program descriptions, which include eligibility rules and limitations, along with application forms and procedures, for approval by the Tribal Governing Board or its designee. Only those descriptions, application forms and procedures which are approved by the Tribal Governing Board or its designee shall be in force and effect. Program guidelines may limit benefits to an identified group of Members or Qualified Nonmembers, as applicable. All Programs may be limited by budget availability. In the absence of specific Program guidelines to the contrary, all Programs shall be deemed to incorporate eligibility criteria necessary for compliance with Code Section 139E.</text>
            <text>All Assistance disbursed or provided pursuant to this Ordinance must be used for the purpose stated in the approved Program description, and any application for the applicable Assistance. The Tribe or its designee shall keep books or records deemed appropriate to demonstrate compliance with the Ordinance. Recipients of benefits hereunder are responsible for maintaining books or records as may be required for substantiation to the IRS for individual income tax purposes. In the event that Assistance payments and/or services are used or pledged for a purpose inconsistent with the purpose set forth in the applicable approved Program or the Member's application, the Tribal Governing Board or designee may require the repayment of the welfare assistance payment. The Tribal Governing Board or designee is authorized to offset any other payments owed to a Tribal member if such an offset is necessary to secure repayment of a welfare assistance payment in accordance with <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Code of Law" path="GWE.1.4.030">this Section</cite>.</text>

            <text>The Tribal Governing Board, within its annual budgets, by resolution or by motion, may adopt guidelines establishing the maximum Assistance payments to be made to Tribal members for certain specified purposes or programs or may delegate the establishment of such limitations to the program level. Such guidelines may also include, by way of example, factors to be considered in determining whether deviations from the general payment limitations should be permitted. Departments charged with administering particular programs may be delegated authority to adopt program guidelines to the extent not contrary to the overall guidelines and limitations established by the Tribal Governing Board. In no event shall Assistance be lavish or extravagant.</text>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Assistance payments authorized hereunder shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and no Beneficiary shall have an interest in or right to any funds budgeted for or set aside for Assistance payments until actually paid. Assistance benefits shall remain assets of the Tribe until distributed, and the Approved Programs shall be administered to avoid premature taxation through the doctrines of constructive receipt and/or economic benefit.</text>

            <text>Programs that qualify under Code Section 139E or the IRS Safe Harbor shall not require a showing of individual need or means testing in order to achieve non-taxable treatment under the General Welfare Exclusion. The Tribe also reserves the right to provide community-based Programs and Programs based on non-financial need under the General Test that are not individually means tested. The Tribe recognizes that means testing can distort certain tribal cultural and community values. The Tribe has participated in consultation with the United States Treasury Department and IRS and will evaluate Programs periodically as guidance is further developed through consultation with the Tribe.</text>

Without limitation, this includes Member medical benefits exempt under Section 9021 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Code Section 139D) and per capita expenses exempt under 25 U.S.C. Sections 1407 and 1408.</text>
