              <text><u>Requesting Personal Time Off Leave</u>. An essential function in the success of PTO is to ensure team members are given time off to use for vacation and other personal matters. PTO schedules will be determined on a first come first served basis. Prior to the utilization of accrued PTO, team members must schedule and have the use of accrued PTO time approved so it will not interfere with job responsibilities, except as otherwise provided by law. If a team member is on PTO and there is early release or closure of the team member's worksite, the team member shall be credited any such leave during the period of early release or closure. If requesting more than three (3) days of PTO time team members shall obtain prior authorization at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the leave date. The Director/Manager may or may not approve such request depending on a variety of factors, including schedules. In extreme emergency situations the Director/Manager, in consultation with an Executive Team Member, may waive the forty-eight (48) hours notification provision, if requested by the team member in writing citing the reason.</text>

A team member who resigns their employment without providing at least a written two (2) weeks notice will forfeit any accrued PTO unless otherwise approved by his or her Director/Manager in collaboration with the Executive Management Team. No payment of PTO will be made if separation is done while the team member is not in good standing.</text>

When a team member is in need of additional PTO hours to cover an emergency or an absence with extenuating circumstances, the team member is to submit a written request to their Department Director/Manager stating the reason for their request, the dates they need off work, and amount of PTO needed to cover their absence(s). Team members are required to use their available PTO for the absence(s) prior to utilizing any loaned PTO. All PTO hours received as a loan shall be repaid at 50% of their accrual rate, on a weekly basis, beginning the following week that the loan was received.  A maximum of 40 hours can be received as a loan once per calendar year. An additional loan is not allowed until all previous loan amounts have been paid back.</text>
