      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to promote the traditional value that children are the most important asset of the Tribe, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(q)">Article V, § 1 (q)</cite>, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">(s)</cite>, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(t)">(t)</cite>, and <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(u)">(u)</cite> of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "establish a tribal court for the purpose of enforcing tribal ordinance..." <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(q)">Article V, § 1 (q)</cite>; "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice by establishing a tribal court and defining its duties and powers" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1 (s)</cite>; "provide for the regulation of child custody and domestic relations matters by ordinances or resolution" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(t)">Article V, § 1 (t)</cite>; "provide for the appointment of guardians for minors, aged persons, and mental incompetents by ordinance or resolution" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(u)">Article V, § 1 (u)</cite>. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all children within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe.  In the children lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Ojibwe traditions and culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, meditation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment, - but in all decisions made under this ordinance the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.</text>

          <text>Termination of parental rights means that, pursuant to court order, the legal relationship of parent and child is permanently severed.  The effect of a decree of termination of parental rights is to permanently end the parent-child relationship, to remove the parent from all rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, and to sever all legal relationships, including all rights of intestate distribution and succession, custody, control, and financial responsibility, but shall not affect other familial, religious, or tribal relationships arising out of the natural parent-child relationship.</text>

          <text>Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in a proceeding where the petition clearly states that the petitioner is seeking an order of termination of parental rights, and where the mother and father have been summoned to appear before the Children's Court.  The parental rights of an unadjudicated or unacknowledged father may be terminated after service of the summons and petition as provided in <cite path="§DMR.1.6.060">Section DMR.1.6.060</cite> <cite path="§DMR.1.6.060|(a)">Section DMR.1.6.060(a)</cite> and <cite path="§DMR.1.6.060|(b)">Section DMR.1.6.060(b)</cite> of this ordinance on all persons named by the mother as the possible father or, in the case of an unknown father, after publication of the notice as provided in section <cite path="§DMR.1.6.060|(b)">Section DMR.1.6.060(b)</cite> of this ordinance. If any individual appears claiming paternity and contesting the termination of rights, the Court shall establish paternity to its satisfaction before considering the termination of the individual's parental rights.  Where no individual appears claiming paternity and where paternal parental rights are terminated by default, no such termination will be considered conclusive with regard to the child's rights of membership in the Tribe.</text>

          <text>Suspension of parental rights means that, pursuant to court order, the legal relationship of parent and child is suspended as agreed by a biological parent.  The effect of a decree of separation of parental rights is to suspend the parent-child relationship, to suspend the parent from all rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, and to suspend all legal relationships, including all rights of intestate distribution and succession, custody, control, and financial responsibility, but shall not affect other familial, religious, or tribal relationships arising out of the natural parent-child relationship.</text>

        <heading>Purpose</heading>
        <text>When the first European people came and met with the Ojibwe people, they brought alcohol. At first, Indian people thought alcohol was something good because it provided a short cut to dreams and visions. However, the elders realized that these were not the right types of dreams and visions; they were nightmares. The elders tried to convince people to stay away from alcohol but did not succeed. Alcohol took such a strong hold on our people that our people got out of balance with its excessive use. The negative aspect of alcohol took control of our people and make them sick. "Firewater," as alcohol is referred to, has a spiritual meaning. When a person talks with alcohol on their breath, there are flames when they talk; when a person prays with alcohol on their breath, these flames burn their prayers.</text>
        <text>Therefore, we as a community believe we must come together to fight alcohol and drug addiction. Through the services provided by the Lac Courte Oreille Health Center and reliance on our tradition and customs, we will seek to rebuild families and communities that have been torn apart by addiction.</text>

        <heading>Definition</heading>
        <text>The "marital estate" is the income and assets accumulated by the spouses during their marriage, not including gifts or inheritances received by one spouse individually during the marriage. The marital estate does not include individually owned property brought into the marriage by each spouse, but does include income, interest, dividends or increase in value earned by that property during the marriage. The marital estate is reduced by the debts incurred by the parties during the marriage, but not by the individual debts of the parties brought into the marriage, which remain the individual responsibility of the individual who incurred the debt. The Court may determine the extent to which debts incurred individually by one spouse after separation reduce the marital estate. The title by which property or debt is held is not determinative of whether it is part of the marital estate. The parties may, by marital property agreement freely entered into upon full disclosure, modify their marital estate and provide for the division of property and assignment of debts in the event of divorce or separation.</text>

      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1 (s)</cite>, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(t)">(t)</cite>, and <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(u)">(u)</cite> of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice …" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1 (s)</cite>; "provide for the regulation of … domestic relations matters by ordinances or resolution" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(t)">Article V, § 1 (t)</cite>; "provide for the appointment of guardians for … mental incompetents by ordinance or resolution" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(u)">Article V, § 1 (u)</cite>. The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians recognizes the need to promote the traditional value of respect for adults in need of protective placement or guardianship. The Tribe recognizes that adults that suffer from physical or mental disability, incapacity, other disability, or are substantially impaired whether from age, disease, alcohol, substance abuse, or psychological problems all deserve to lead a life of safety and respect. The dignity, self-reliance and rights of adults in need of protective placement or guardianship must be respected by family members, the Tribal community, employees of the Tribe and all people who are part of or inter-act with the Tribe and its adults in need of protective placement or guardianship. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe and to codify a process and procedure governing the appointment of a Guardian for Adults who are incapable of managing their own affairs, require assistance in conducting business, or require assistance in obtaining necessary services. Thus, it is in the best interest of and serves the welfare of the Tribe to protect adults in need of protective placement or guardianship.</text>

        <heading>Policy</heading>
        <text>It is the policy of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe to promote the traditional value of respect for tribal elders and vulnerable adults.  Elders, in particular, are valuable resources to the Tribe because they are repositories and custodians of tribal history, culture, and tradition and they are the best hope of the Tribe to pass on the tribal history, culture, and tradition to the children of the Tribe.  Elders also have valuable skills and knowledge as a result of their life experiences that, when shared, can offer important insights to younger generations and contribute to a healthy future for the Tribe.  Thus, it is in the best interest of and serves the welfare of the Tribe to protect tribal elders.</text>

    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1(s) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</cite> empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "establish a tribal court for the purpose of enforcing tribal ordinance..." <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(q)">Article V, § 1(q)</cite>; "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice by establishing a tribal court and defining its duties and powers" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1(s)</cite>; "provide for the regulation of child custody and domestic relations matters by ordinance or resolution" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(t)">Article V, § 1 (t)</cite>. It is the purpose of this ordinance to establish paternity and child support guidelines and procedures for the enforcement of child support and to provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of child support orders and judgments. Indian children are the most vital and valued resource to the continued existence, the future, and integrity of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe. The establishment of these guidelines and procedures is in the best interests of all families within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe, and especially its children, who have a right and need to receive support from their parents.</text>

        <text>It is the purpose of this ordinance to establish paternity and child support guidelines and procedures for the enforcement of child support and to provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of child support orders and judgments. Further, to ensure that parentage is identified for each child within our jurisdiction.
