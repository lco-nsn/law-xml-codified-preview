    <text class="center">
      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to promote the traditional value that children are the most important asset of the Tribe, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, § 1 (q), (s), (t), and (u) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "establish a tribal court for the purpose of enforcing tribal ordinance..." Article V, § 1 (q); "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice by establishing a tribal court and defining its duties and powers" Article V, § 1 (s); "provide for the regulation of child custody and domestic relations matters by ordinances or resolution" Article V, § 1 (t); "provide for the appointment of guardians for minors, aged persons, and mental incompetents by ordinance or resolution" Article V, § 1 (u). It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all children within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe.  In the children lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Ojibwe traditions and culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, meditation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment, - but in all decisions made under this ordinance the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.</text>

If any individual appears claiming paternity and contesting the termination of rights, the Court shall establish paternity to its satisfaction before considering the termination of the individual's parental rights.

        <heading>Purpose</heading>
        <text>When the first European people came and met with the Ojibwe people, they brought alcohol. At first, Indian people thought alcohol was something good because it provided a short cut to dreams and visions. However, the elders realized that these were not the right types of dreams and visions; they were nightmares. The elders tried to convince people to stay away from alcohol but did not succeed. Alcohol took such a strong hold on our people that our people got out of balance with its excessive use. The negative aspect of alcohol took control of our people and make them sick. "Firewater," as alcohol is referred to, has a spiritual meaning. When a person talks with alcohol on their breath, there are flames when they talk; when a person prays with alcohol on their breath, these flames burn their prayers.</text>
        <text>Therefore, we as a community believe we must come together to fight alcohol and drug addiction. Through the services provided by the Lac Courte Oreille Health Center and reliance on our tradition and customs, we will seek to rebuild families and communities that have been torn apart by addiction.</text>

    <heading>Guardianship Of Adults And Protective Placement Code Of The Lac Courte Oreilles Band Of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</heading>
    <prefix>Chapter</prefix>
    <text class="center">
      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, § 1 (s), (t), and (u) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice …" Article V, § 1 (s); "provide for the regulation of … domestic relations matters by ordinances or resolution" Article V, § 1 (t); "provide for the appointment of guardians for … mental incompetents by ordinance or resolution" Article V, § 1 (u). The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians recognizes the need to promote the traditional value of respect for adults in need of protective placement or guardianship. The Tribe recognizes that adults that suffer from physical or mental disability, incapacity, other disability, or are substantially impaired whether from age, disease, alcohol, substance abuse, or psychological problems all deserve to lead a life of safety and respect. The dignity, self-reliance and rights of adults in need of protective placement or guardianship must be respected by family members, the Tribal community, employees of the Tribe and all people who are part of or inter-act with the Tribe and its adults in need of protective placement or guardianship. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe and to codify a process and procedure governing the appointment of a Guardian for Adults who are incapable of managing their own affairs, require assistance in conducting business, or require assistance in obtaining necessary services. Thus, it is in the best interest of and serves the welfare of the Tribe to protect adults in need of protective placement or guardianship.</text>

    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to promote the traditional value of respect for tribal elders and vulnerable adults which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, § 1(s) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to "promulgate and enforce ordinances governing the conduct of members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice …" It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect elders and vulnerable adults within the jurisdiction of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe from abuse and neglect as defined in this ordinance.  This ordinance provides for: (a) reporting abuse or neglect to the proper agency; (b) receiving reports of and investigating suspected abuse or neglect; and (c) delivering elder protection services.</text>

        <heading>Policy</heading>
        <text>It is the policy of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe to promote the traditional value of respect for tribal elders and vulnerable adults.  Elders, in particular, are valuable resources to the Tribe because they are repositories and custodians of tribal history, culture, and tradition and they are the best hope of the Tribe to pass on the tribal history, culture, and tradition to the children of the Tribe.  Elders also have valuable skills and knowledge as a result of their life experiences that, when shared, can offer important insights to younger generations and contribute to a healthy future for the Tribe.  Thus, it is in the best interest of and serves the welfare of the Tribe to protect tribal elders.</text>

      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the delivery of elder services which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, §§ 1(l) and (m) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "organize, charter and regulate any association or group, including a housing authority, for the purpose of providing social or economic benefits to the members of the Band or residents of the reservation" Article V, § 1 (l);  and "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers" Article V, § 1 (m). This ordinance promotes the well-being of older individuals by providing services and programs designed to help them live independently in their homes and communities. This ordinance also empowers the Tribal government to receive funds form the Federal and State governments for supportive services for individuals over the age of 55.</text>
