        <heading>Summary Judgment</heading>
        <text>At any time not barred by a scheduling order in the case, a party may move for summary judgment on any claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim, which shall be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and evidentiary affidavits on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving or opposing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court may, in its discretion, hold a non-evidentiary hearing on the motion. Any material upon which the motion is based which is not on file at the time of the filing of the motion shall be filed with the motion. Any counter affidavits or other material in opposition to the motion shall be filed and served within the time set by scheduling order, or if none is in effect, no more than 21 days after service of the motion and supporting papers on the responding party. If the court holds a hearing on the motion, it shall be no sooner than five days after the last date allowed for filing responsive materials. Interlocutory summary judgment may be entered on some but not all claims or issues in a case. The court may enter summary judgment in favor of a party even though the party has not moved for summary judgment, if the materials submitted in support of and opposition to another party's motion for summary judgment show that summary judgment is appropriate under the standards set by <cite path="§TCT.2.11.030">this section</cite>.</text>

        <text>The only review of a Tribal Court order or judgment shall be an appeal to the Lac Courte Oreilles Court of Appeals, as provided in this Code. For all appeals, the Attorney Judge of the Court of Appeals shall conduct a preliminary review of the record on appeal and determine whether the appeal presents an error of law or fact, which may warrant reversal or remand, based upon application of the standard of review stated in <cite path="§TCT.3.4.050">Section TCT.3.4.050</cite>. The Attorney Judge may request additional information before any decision is made including, but not limited to, written briefs and/or a hearing. If the Attorney Judge determines that no such error or omission exits, the Attorney Judge shall explain the grounds for dismissal in a written decision. If the Attorney Judge determines that such an issue may exist, the appeal shall be forwarded to the full three- Judge panel which includes the Attorney Judge for a decision.</text>

        <text>Except as otherwise provided by tribal law or resolution, any final judgment or order of the Tribal Court may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. A final judgment or order is one which disposes of all issues in litigation between at least two parties to a case.</text>

            <text>Nothing but a final judgment or order may be appealed. If an order in a case leaves other matters to be decided, and does not completely settle all disputed issues between the parties, so that the Tribal Court still has work to do, then the order is not final and an appeal cannot be filed. In cases involving multiple parties, an order or judgment may dispose of all issues between two or more of the parties, and would therefore be appealable. In cases involving multiple issues, an order disposing of one or more issues may leave others as yet unresolved and would therefore not be appealable.</text>

The notice of appeal shall bear the caption and case number of the case in the Tribal Court and shall be labeled "Notice of Appeal."

No appeal shall be dismissed for any formal defects in the notice of appeal as long as the matter appealed is clearly identified and filing and service are timely and properly made.

Briefs are made optional, in recognition that some self-represented parties may not wish to file briefs but may rather wish to present their cases solely in oral argument.

            <text>The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision-making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed.</text>
            <text>Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in <cite path="§TCT.3.4.050">this section</cite>; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Governing Board may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.</text>

            <text>Subsections (a) and (d) preserve the basic function of the appeals court as a court of review, not a court of initial determination. The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see that the record is fully developed.</text>
            <text><cite path="§TCT.3.4.070|(b)">Section TCT.3.4.070(b)</cite> protects the court and parties from expending energy on issues that an appellant has no intention of pursuing.</text>
            <text><cite path="§TCT.3.4.070|(c)">Section TCT.3.4.070(c)</cite> states the principle that a court will not decide issues over which there is no current controversy. The controversy that existed during trial may be over by the time of appeal. The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot. Since the issue could recur, but would always become moot before it was ready for decision, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</text>
