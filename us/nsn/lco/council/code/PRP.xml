        <heading>Purpose</heading>
        <text>The Housing Authority recognizes that one of the most important aspects of the operations of the Housing Authority is the maintenance of Housing Authority owned and managed units. If units are not maintained on a regular basis, the long-term viability of the Housing Authority as a property management entity is threatened and the Tribe and the residents will lose a valuable resource. These procedures are intended to implement a full system of maintenance for those units where the Housing Authority has the obligation to perform the maintenance as required. Therefore, the purpose of the Housing Authority's maintenance procedures shall be to:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Maintain all property and equipment under the management of the Housing Authority in a decent, safe and sanitary condition.</text>

              <text>For units where the test results come back with a reading of 1.5 ug/100cm2 or above, cleanup shall be completed by a qualified remediation contractor. A Qualified Contractor will consist of a contractor who has hazardous waste expertise and is certified to conduct clean-up operations in a meth contaminated condition. Contractors who have not been certified in a similar program should, at minimum, complete the 40-hour HAZWOPER training (OSHA <cite path="cfr 1910.120">29 CFR § 1910.120</cite>). The contractors will need to provide the Housing Authority with documentation of completion for each employee who will be doing meth remediation. A Clearance test will be performed by a third-party test to insure the unit has been cleaned to at or below the Housing Authority set standard. The Housing Authority will pay for the first clearance test, if this test fails the Housing Authority will pay half the cost of the second test and the qualified contractor will be responsible to cover the other half of the testing cost. If the second test were to fail then the contractor will be responsible to cover all cost associated with the third test and any other testing after that. The Housing Authority shall hold $1500.00 from each remediation contract to cover the cost of testing until the unit passes a clearance test. Cleanup pertaining to these units shall have a scope of work established by the Housing Authority Inspector. This may require removal of all woodwork, any porous material, all affected cabinets and countertops, replace appliances and any other area as determined by the inspector and as written in the scope of work.</text>

These guidelines are established as a result of 49 CFR Part 24 - Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Regulations for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs (hereinafter "URA"). Prior to HUD approval for any grant, contract; or agreement requiring relocation activity under which federal funds provide financial assistance, the Housing Authority must provide a certification of compliance that it will comply with the URA. The Housing Authority will take appropriate measures to carry out the requirements contained in this policy in a manner that minimizes fraud, waste, and mismanagement. Instances of fraud and waste will be handled appropriately by the Housing Authority or referred to HUD's Office of Inspector General.</text>

          <text>Each Homeowner will be eligible with respect to the applicant's primary residence, including a dwelling to be made habitable so it may serve as the homeowner's primary residence, or improvements that allow a senior to age in place. Assistance will be provided to homeowners to ensure the habitability of the home through reasonable repairs and other renovations that increase the useful life of the dwelling and reasonable home repair expenses to the homeowner's primary residence as necessary to restore the property to habitable condition or to resolve housing/property code violations. HAF Funds may be used to pay the reasonable cost of repairs necessary to address property conditions, including pre-development costs, necessary architectural or engineering fees, construction oversight, or other costs incidental but necessary to the completion of the eligible scope of work. The Tribe will utilize HAF administrative funds to provide technical assistance to the homeowner (e.g., identifying and contracting for the necessary repair work).</text>
          <text><strong><u>Eligible Property Conditions</u></strong>:</text>
          <text>● Property will continue to be the applicant's owner-occupied primary residence once the repairs are made.</text>
          <text>● Properties that have outstanding violations may receive assistance if corrections are addressed before funding or are included in the scope of work funded by the program.</text>
          <text>● Housing deficiencies or conditions exist which may be hazardous to occupants/residents,</text>
          <text>● Property has a code violation or other citation, or is in danger of being cited or condemned, without the necessary repair,</text>
          <text>● Property is uninhabitable or condemned and the repair is necessary to make the home habitable, OR</text>
          <text>● Home improvements are necessary to improve accessibility and help senior residents age in place.</text>
          <text>● Repairs will be completed by a professional local contractor found to be qualified and reputable in accordance with reasonable criteria established by the Tribe;</text>
          <text>● Copy of contract must be provided to the program for approval, or homeowners and contractors must use a program-approved contract template.</text>
          <text>● Projects must comply with applicable building and other applicable code requirements.</text>
          <text>Funds will be paid directly to the general contractor or entity responsible for the repairs/ installation upon satisfactory completion of the work. HAF technical assistance funds will be utilized to ensure reasonable oversight of the quality and completion of work will be performed before full payment is made.</text>

        <text>Treasury will make initial payments from the HAF Program available to eligible entities that are approved to participate in the HAF Program, in an amount equal to 10% of the total amount allocated to the eligible entity. In order to receive this initial payment, The Tribe must (1) enter into the ﬁnancial assistance agreement with Treasury described above, and (2) commit to use the funds only for qualiﬁed expenses other than <cite path="XI|9|9.8|9.802|(9)">subsection (9)</cite> of the "Qualiﬁed Expenses" section above. Treasury will make payments to the Tribe, or an agency of the eligible entity identiﬁed on the eligible entity's notice of funds request. No more than 50% of the initial payment may be used for planning, community engagement, needs assessment, and administrative expenses described in <cite path="XI|9|9.8|9.802|(10)">subsection (10)</cite> of the "Qualiﬁed Expenses" section above. An eligible entity that elects not to receive this initial payment may receive its allocated funds after Treasury approves its HAF plan. Treasury encourages HAF participants to use these initial payments to create or fund pilot programs to serve targeted populations, and to focus on programs that are most likely to deliver resources most quickly to targeted populations, such as mortgage reinstatement programs.</text>

    <prefix>Chapter</prefix>
    <text class="center">
      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This Code is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to provide a system for the Tribe to offer long term leasing options on trust land for the members of the Tribe and other individuals and entities that no longer requires the Secretary of Interior approval and restores inherent tribal sovereignty, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to "promulgate and enforce ordinances. . . providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice…" (<cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, §§1(s)</cite>); to "manage, lease, permit or otherwise deal with tribal lands, interests in lands or other assets, and to purchase lands, or interests in lands, within or without the reservation" (<cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(f)">Article V, § 1 (f)</cite>); and  to "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Tribe any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers" (<cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(m)">Article V, § 1 (m)</cite>). Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby enacts this Code which shall establish the purposes, powers and duties of the Land Management Division and the system for leasing tribal trust lands. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any of its leases, the Land Management Division shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of the adoption of this Code. A copy of this Code duly certified by the Secretary/Treasurer of the Tribal Governing Board shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action, or proceeding.</text>
