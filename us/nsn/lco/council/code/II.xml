The court may, in its discretion, hold a non-evidentiary hearing on the motion. Any material upon which the motion is based which is not on file at the time of the filing of the motion shall be filed with the motion. Any counter affidavits or other material in opposition to the motion shall be filed and served within the time set by scheduling order, or if none is in effect, no more than 21 days after service of the motion and supporting papers on the responding party. If the court holds a hearing on the motion, it shall be no sooner than five days after the last date allowed for filing responsive materials. Interlocutory summary judgment may be entered on some but not all claims or issues in a case. The court may enter summary judgment in favor of a party even though the party has not moved for summary judgment, if the materials submitted in support of and opposition to another party's motion for summary judgment show that summary judgment is appropriate under the standards set by <cite path="II|1|1.11|1.1103">this section</cite>.</text>

    <text class="center">
      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to protect and preserve the sovereign immunity of the Tribe, to define the entities and individuals entitled to the protection of such immunity, and to specify the manner in which such immunity may be waived, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, § 1(s) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "To promulgate and enforce ordinances…providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice…" Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby recognizes that Tribal sovereign immunity, as defined in numerous federal court decisions, is an inherent and indispensable aspect of Tribal sovereignty. The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians also recognizes that Tribal sovereign immunity affords necessary protection of Tribal resources, and necessary protection for Tribal officers, employees, and agents in both governmental and commercial settings.</text>
