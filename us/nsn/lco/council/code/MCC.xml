        <heading>Authority</heading>
        <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the operation of the Tribal Government and the delivery of governmental services which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|III">Articles III</cite> and <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V">V</cite> of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "determine its own procedures" <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|III|6">Article III, § 6</cite>; and "to regulate, by enactment of ordinances, the conduct of business within the territory of the Band," <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(n)">Article V, § 1 (n)</cite>. The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government is founded on the consent of the governed. The citizens of the Tribe are entitled to have complete confidence in the loyalty and integrity of their Elected Officials. To that end this ordinance establishes clear standards of ethical conduct and behavior of the Elected Officials to the Tribal Governing Board. This ordinance seeks to require accountability to the citizens of the Tribe by the Tribal Governing Board in exercising the authority vested with them. It is the intention of the Tribal Governing Board that the provisions of this ordinance be construed and applied in each instance, so as to accomplish its purpose in protecting the Tribe's citizens from government decisions and actions resulting from, or affected by, undue influence or conflict of interest.</text>

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual Elected Officials may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on performance of their office. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all Elected Officials, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Elected Officials are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Elected Officials are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Elected Officials may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Elected Officials may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the Elected Official may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences.</text>

The Tribal Governing Board recognizes that drug problems associated with an Elected Official can tremendously affect his or her capacity and motivation to carry out their duties of protecting the sovereignty, safety, and economic well-being of the Tribe and its citizens and enforcing the laws on their behalf. Drug problems associated with an Elected Official can also cause shame, enormous pain and anguish to the citizens of this Tribe as well as hurt, confusion, and disappointment to the Tribe's young people who should be looking at their leaders as role models to be admired and followed. For the aforementioned reasons, no Elected Official under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances as established in <cite path="|MCC.1.2.010|(o)">Section MCC.1.2.010(o)</cite> shall be permitted to perform the duties associated with their office.</text>

          <text>While the Tribe encourages its Elected Officials to enjoy and make good use of their off-duty time, certain activities on the part of Elected Officials may become a concern if they have the effect of impairing the work of the official duties of the government; harassing, demeaning, or creating a hostile working environment for any Elected Official or employee; disrupting the smooth and orderly flow of work within the office; or harming the goodwill and reputation of the Tribe. In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), Elected Officials may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

    <text class="center">
      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government, relating to the grant of pardons or forgiveness to individuals upon demonstration of full rehabilitation, trustworthiness and/or commitment to lawful behavior. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(m)">Article V, § 1 (m)</cite> and <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">(s)</cite> of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers," <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(m)">Article V, § 1 (m)</cite>; and "promulgate and enforce ordinances...providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice..." <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|V|1|(s)">Article V, § 1 (s)</cite>. Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby recognizes that the purpose of this ordinance is to provide a fair, efficient and formal process by which: (a) a Tribal Member may receive a pardon for the conviction of a crime(s); or (b) a Tribal Member or non-Tribal Member may receive forgiveness for acts that render him or her ineligible for Tribal employment; an occupational license, certification, or permit issued by the Tribe; a foster care license issued by the Tribe; or other Tribal benefit.</text>
