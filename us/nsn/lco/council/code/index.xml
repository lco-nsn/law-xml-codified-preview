          <heading>Purpose</heading>
          <text>The Tribe depends heavily on its information resources today and will become even more dependent on them in the future. Information is one of the Tribe's most important assets. Protection of information assets is necessary to establish and maintain trust between Tribal members, Tribal Departments and Entities,  Tribal leadership, and third-party  vendors . The security of the Tribe's systems and information is essential to its safety and to the privacy of Tribal financial information. The purpose of this policy is to establish general guidelines for maintaining a computing environment within the Tribe that is controlled, consistent and secure. The policy's primary objective is to enhance the productivity of users by optimizing network performance, reducing wasted use of resources and the risk of legal liability caused by illegal or inappropriate use of the Network, and to provide for Network security and safety. The Tribe is establishing standards relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for Tribal records and information. These safeguards are to ensure the security and confidentiality of Tribal records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of these records, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of these records or information that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the Tribe or a Tribal member. Attacks frequently compromise personal and business data; it is critical for the Tribe to respond quickly and effectively when security breaches occur by implementing an Incident Response Program that responds to incidents in a consistent manner so that the appropriate actions are taken. These incident response measures help personnel to minimize loss or theft of information and disruption of services, including the ability to use information gained during the incident to better prepare for handling future incidents and to provide stronger protection for systems and data.</text>

          <text>The Tribe recognizes that employees may post personal information on the Internet through personal websites, social media, blogs and/or uploading content to websites and the like. The Tribe respects our employee's interest in participating in these forms of personal expression on their own time. Employees should be aware; however, that problems can arise when personal postings identify or appear to be associated with the Tribe, or when a personal posting is used in ways that violate the Tribe's rights or the rights of other employees.</text>
          <text>Each employee is legally responsible for content they post on the Internet, whether on a social network, website or otherwise. You can be held personally liable for defaming others, revealing trade secrets, confidential information or proprietary information, etc. Tribal policies apply to what you post on the Internet. For example, you may not use personal postings to harass or threaten other employees or reveal confidential tribal information. Embarrassing or unkind comments about tribal employees or members, customers, or competitors are also inappropriate. Posting anonymously or under a pseudonym, does not protect your real identity; it can be discovered relatively easily.</text>
