        <text>Whenever an injury for which benefits are payable under this Ordinance occurs under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the Employer, the injured Employee may either claim benefits under this Ordinance or proceed at law against such other person to recover damages, but the Employee shall not collect from both.</text>

        <text>If benefits have been awarded or paid under this Ordinance, and the Employee has suffered damages for which a person other than the Employer is legally liable on account of the same injury or condition for which benefits were paid, the Employer may collect in its own name or that of the injured Employee an amount equal to the amount of benefits paid by the Employer to the Employee. Acceptance of benefits under this Ordinance constitutes an assignment of the Employee's rights to the Employer to the extent benefits are paid or payable.</text>

The Insurance Office will review the Report, and if warranted, will then, in a timely manner, forward the Report to the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider for evaluation and determination as to whether it is a valid claim under this Ordinance. The Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider will, within fourteen (14) workdays of their receipt of the Report, provide written notice to the Employer's Insurance Office as to whether the claim has been approved or denied. The Insurance Office will notify the appropriate personnel of the decision.

          <text>Temporary Partial Disability</text>
          <text>This benefit represents sixty-seven (67%) of the difference between the pre-injury weekly wage and weekly wage the Employee earns after returning to light duty restricted modified work if the wage loss is due solely to the injury and disability suffered while in the course and scope of the employment with the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government. Temporary partial disability benefits are subject to the same maximums and restrictions as temporary total disability benefits.</text>

          <text>Permanent Partial Disability</text>
          <text>This benefit will compensate the injured Employee for any permanent loss/loss of use of a body part suffered as a result of compensable bodily injury. The designated percentage of the disability rating is multiplied by the weekly permanent disability benefit, which determines the dollar amount payable to the Employee and is allocated in one lump sum. Permanent partial disability benefits are not payable concurrently with temporary total/temporary partial benefits. To determine Permanent Partial Disability the health care provider must use the American Medical Association's "Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Partial Impairment,'' 5<sup>th</sup> Edition.</text>

          <text>As determined by the Plan Administrator, payments to the legal spouse shall be for a maximum of one (1) year, terminating upon the remarriage or death of the spouse, whichever comes first. Payments to a dependent child/children shall be made until the dependent child/children reaches the age of 18 unless the dependent child/children is a full-time student or determined by medical evidence to be physically or mentally incapable of self-support, in which case payment shall be made to age 25.</text>

        <text>If it is established at the Lac Courte Oreilles Insurance Appeal Board hearing that two (2) or more parties have each contributed to a physical or mental condition for which benefits would be otherwise due, liability for such benefits shall be apportioned according to the proof of the relative contribution to disability resulting from the injury or illness.</text>
        <text>If after the Lac Courte Oreilles Insurance Appeal Board hearing, it has been determined that an injured Employee is entitled to compensation but that there remains in dispute only the issue of which of two (2) or more parties are liable for that compensation and one of the parties is the Employer, the Lac Courte Oreilles Insurance Appeal Board may recommend that the Employer pay the prorated share in an amount, time and manner as determined. If the Lac Courte Oreilles Insurance Appeal Board later determines another party is liable for compensation, reimbursement will be sought from the responsible party.</text>
