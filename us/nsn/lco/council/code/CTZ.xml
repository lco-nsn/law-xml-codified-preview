    </text>

It is the purpose of this ordinance to: (1) define and regulate membership in the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe; and (2) establish an orderly enrollment procedure which affords due process of Tribal law to all persons.</text>

    </text>
    <text>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to determine its Tribal citizenship which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|II|2">Article II, §§ 2</cite>, <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|II|3">3</cite> and <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution|II|4">4</cite> of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to enact an ordinance pertaining to citizenship. A critical component of the implementation of the Citizenship Code is the establishment of the Citizenship Committee. The responsibility of the Citizenship Committee is to review applications for Tribal citizenship, accept relinquishment requests, accept requests to rescind relinquishment, and recommend the acceptance or rejection of Citizenship applications or renunciation petitions to the Tribal Governing Board.</text>
