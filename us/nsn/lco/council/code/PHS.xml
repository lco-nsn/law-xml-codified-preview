        <text>If there is reasonable cause to believe that any construction, sanitary condition, operation of the establishment or of equipment or a procedural practice creates an immediate danger to health, an employee of the Department upon the recommendation of the Division, without written notice, issue a temporary order to remove the immediate danger to health. The order shall take effect upon delivery to the operator or other person in charge of the tattoo or body piercing establishment and shall remain in effect for fourteen (14) days unless it is terminated by the Division or the Department by notice to the operator within that period or is kept in effect beyond that period. The order shall be limited to prohibiting specific procedures or methods of operation, or a combination of these, except that if a more limited order will not remove the immediate danger to health, the order may direct that all operations authorized by the license cease. If, before the temporary order expires, the Department determines that the immediate danger to health does in fact exist and continues to exist, the temporary order shall remain in effect, and may be extended, with notification to the operator.</text>
