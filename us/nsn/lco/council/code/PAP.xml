        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution">Amended Constitution and Bylaws</cite> of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="PAP|PAP.1|PAP.1.12">Subchapter PAP.1.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <heading>Conflict of Interest</heading>
        <text>Employees are not permitted to engage in nepotism, favoritism, and any outside business transactions, or other activities, which are detrimental to the best interests of the Tribe. This includes activities that, directly or indirectly, divert business opportunities from the Tribe or confer an unfair advantage upon or benefit to a family member. It also includes activities that negatively reflect upon the Tribe's image or are contrary to the mission of the Tribe, except for activities specifically protected by law. The Tribe respects the right of employees to engage in activities outside their employment that are of a private nature and unrelated to their job or the Tribe. However, employees must fully disclose to their department head or director or the Human Resource Director, or designee, all business and personal activities that represent such a conflict of interest with the Tribe. If an employee is unsure whether a conflict of interest exists, the employee is encouraged to seek the advice of the Human Resource Director, or designee.</text>

        <text>All employees and applicants for employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing, including reasonable suspicion, pre-employment, and return-to-duty; with the exception of TANF, WIOA &amp; WIOA youth workers. Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Tribal Governing Board, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</text>

In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above.

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the Tribe and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the Tribe supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>If you have a work related or personal problem that you think the Tribe can help you resolve, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor. Your supervisor is usually in the best position to help you.</text>

            <num>(2)</num>
            <text>If you do not get an answer, or you are not satisfied with the answer, the issue should be written down and presented to the Human Resources Director.  The Human Resources Director will facilitate a meeting to assist with mutually resolving the issue.</text>

          <num>(b)</num>
          <text><u>Chain of Command</u>. All employees are required to follow the chain of command, with no exceptions. The chain of command consists of and is limited to the following:</text>

            <num>(1)</num>

        <para>
          <num>(c)</num>
          <text><u>Open Communication Policy</u>. The Tribe supports open lines of communication between employees, which assures all employees concerns will be heard and considered. It is the belief and commitment of the Tribe to maintain direct lines of communication and good working relationships with all employees. Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

        <text>Each employee shall agree to, by signing, a Consent to Appeal Procedure as a condition of continued employment. The Appeals Procedure constitutes a contract between the Tribe and the employee and establishes the framework under which employees may appeal disciplinary action imposed under <cite path="PAP|PAP.1|PAP.1.12">this subchapter</cite> or employment claims, provided no employee can appeal any disciplinary action based on activity that results in an arrest and conviction. In addition, regarding employment claims, it is important to note that nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe consenting to application of any law or waiving applicable defenses, including the defense that the subject law does not apply to the Tribe.</text>

        <heading>Application</heading>
        <text>This ordinance shall govern all contracts and grants for the procurement of supplies, services, and construction entered into by the Tribe.  It shall apply to purchasing, irrespective of the source of funds, including contracts, which do not involve an obligation of funds (such as concession contracts); however, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the Tribe from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift, or bequest that is otherwise consistent with law.</text>
        <text>When both federal and non-federal funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified. The term "<em>procurement</em>," as used in this ordinance includes both contracts and modifications (including change orders) for construction or services, as well as purchase, lease, or rental of supplies and equipment.</text>

        <heading>Consistency with Good Business Practices</heading>
        <text>The fundamental goal of the Tribe's procurement system is to satisfy end users in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service while complying with applicable laws, rules, and the Tribe's own policies. Further, those involved in the procurement function should exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing best value product or services in meeting the tribe's needs.  Consistent with that goal, the CPO may assume that, if a specific strategy, practice, policy or product is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this procurement ordinance, the strategy, practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The CPO is advised to seek advice whenever doubts arise about an intended strategy, practice, policy or procedure.</text>

        <text>Certain information about the Tribe's procurements are normally considered public (e.g. name of the winner contractor and total contract price) and may be released to the public in accordance with this procurement ordinance as well as applicable tribal laws and regulations governing information.</text>
        <text>Other information related to procurement is often protected from disclosure (e.g., proprietary business information such as technical methods or processes, detailed pricing information, personal information, or other information).  The Tribe must exercise caution to ensure that protected information is not made public. Contracting personnel should consult the Tribe's Legal Department whenever there is any question regarding the release of information.</text>

          <text>Generally, this procurement ordinance delegates responsibility for procurement functions to the Tribal Governing Board (hereinafter "TGB").  As established in Article V(1)(c) of the Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and Bylaws dated November 2, 1966, the TGB has the power to exercise or limit any procedures, agreements, or contracts including this procurement ordinance.  Furthermore, projects developed with the use of federal monies are also subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990;  OMB Circular A-87; and Section 7(b) and (c) of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. §450e(c)).</text>

The CPO shall issue operational procedures, including procedures for the processing of purchase orders, to implement this ordinance. Violation of this ordinance, including the ethical standards, shall constitute insubordination and shall be subject to disciplinary action (which may include suspension and/or termination) by the TGB.</text>

        <text>Each contract or purchase action (e.g., new contract, modification, interagency agreement, purchase order, etc.) that obligates the Tribe to pay a contractor or vendor must be approved by the TGB or otherwise authorized by an individual to whom the Tribe has expressly delegated the authority to make such an obligation.</text>
        <text>The approval of the TGB on contracts is a legal commitment and requires continuing performance by the Tribe under the terms and conditions of the contact. Performance includes such duties as monitoring contractor performance and for the acceptance or rejection of contractors' requests for changes in performance, specification, or price.</text>
        <text><strong>Caution:</strong> Only the TGB is authorized to bind the Tribe by making an implied contract such as making a promise or stating an intent to purchase, either orally or in writing. Under the laws of the Tribe, the Tribe may be liable for, or bound by, an action of the CPO, or his/her designee only if the offeror has been given authority by the TGB. Therefore, all unapproved actions that could be misinterpreted as committing the TGB to purchase should be clarified with a statement such as, "this request for price quotation is not an offer to buy and should not be assumed as such."</text>

          <heading>General.</heading>
          <text>Planning is essential to managing the procurement function properly; however the type and extent of planning will depend on, among other factors, the method and size of the procurement, with larger and more complex procurements requiring more planning.</text>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>Careful advance planning provides the Tribe with adequate time to accomplish its procurement actions. Advance planning helps to: maximize competitive pricing among contracts and decrease the Tribe's procurement costs; without any need for re-procurement, e.g., resolving bid protest; and minimize errors that occur when there is inadequate lead-time. Contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, and invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>(2)</num>
            <text>The Tribe should periodically review their record of prior purchases, as well as future needs to find patterns of procurement actions that could be performed more efficiently or economically. Items purchased repetitively might be obtained more economically through various master contracts.  However, consideration should be given to storage, security, and  handling requirements when planning these types of purchasing actions.  For example, it may not be economical or prudent to buy truckloads of a product at deep discounts if there is no appropriate storage space for the product or if the cost of handling the product would exceed the savings price.</text>

Those factors would include length of period the equipment is to be used and the extent of use within that period; financial and operating advantages of alternative types and makes of equipment; cumulative rental payments for the estimated period of use; net purchase price; transportation and installation; maintenance and other service costs; potential obsolescence of the equipment because of imminent technological improvements; availability of the purchase items; trade-in or salvage value; imputed interest; and availability of servicing capability (for example, whether the equipment can be serviced by Tribal staff).</text>

        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>The ICE is an estimate of the cost of the goods or services to be acquired under a contract or a modification. It serves as the Tribe's standard for evaluating the reasonableness of the contractor's proposed cost or prices.</text>

          <num>(c)</num>
          <text>While the CPO is responsible for the preparation of the ICE, other personnel (e.g., the end user, or budget and finance) are usually involved and may actually do most of the preparation.  The Tribe may develop the ICE using its own employees, outside parties (e.g., consultants), or a combination of the two. If any outside party (whether compensated or not) assists in developing the ICE, the Tribe must take the appropriate action to ensure that organizational conflicts of interest are avoided and that the outside party does not obtain any competitive advantage from its advance knowledge of the Tribe's cost estimate.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(d)</num>
          <text>The CPO shall prepare, or have prepared an ICE commensurate with the purchase requirement. The level of detail will depend upon the dollar value of the proposed contract and the nature of the goods or services to be acquired. The ICE must be prepared prior to the solicitation of offers. The requirements for ICEs are:</text>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <heading>For Purchases Less Than $3,000.</heading>
            <text>The CPO generally does not need to prepare an ICE. Price reasonableness normally will be based on a comparison with historical prices paid for the item, commercial catalog prices, or other offers.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>(2)</num>
            <heading>For Purchases Above $3,000.</heading>
            <text>For Purchases above $3,000 but less than the Tribe's small purchase threshold ($150,000), documentation should be kept to a minimum. The ICE may be based on prior purchases, commercial catalogs, or detailed analyses (e.g., purchases for services).</text>

          <para>
            <num>(3)</num>
            <heading>For Purchases Above the Tribe's Small Purchase Threshold.</heading>
            <text>The level of detail will vary but should be commensurate with the size (i.e. dollar value), complexity, and commercial nature of the requirement. ICEs are normally broken out into major categories of cost (e.g., labor, materials, and other direct costs such as travel, overhead, and profit). Commercially available products and services may require less detail as the marketplace tends to provide current reliable pricing information for commercially available products; a CPO may also not need to break out components. Non-commercial type requirements, and work designed specifically for the tribe will require much more extensive estimation and detailed ICE.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(e)</num>
          <text>The ICE serves as the primary in-house gauge of cost and price reasonableness, but it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of other sources of pricing information. Market conditions may fluctuate between the time the ICE is prepared and the receipt of offers. For example, materials or labor cost may have increased or decreased. If a significant period of time has elapsed, or the CPO knows that certain market conditions have changed, the CPO should request that an updated ICE be prepared to use in evaluating offers.</text>

          <text>Procurements shall be conducted competitively to the maximum extent possible. However, procurement by noncompetitive proposal may be used when the award of a contract is not feasible using small purchase procedures, sealed bids, or competitive proposals, and one of the following applies:</text>

            <text>An emergency exists that seriously threatens the public health, welfare, or safety, or endangers property, or would otherwise cause serious injury to the Tribe, as may arise by reason of a flood, earthquake, epidemic, riot, equipment failure, or similar event. In such cases, there must be an immediate and serious need for supplies, services or construction such that the need cannot be met through any other procurement methods. Note: The emergency procurement shall be limited to those supplies, services, or construction necessary to meet the emergency. In cases where labor is involved, Davis-Bacon wage or Tribally determined wage rates will apply and a determination has to be acquired if the amount of the work is over the $5,000 threshold;</text>

          <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE:</strong>
        </aftertext>
        <aftertext>Eligibility for Indian preference shall be established in accordance with the requirements of federal law. If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</aftertext>
        <aftertext><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</aftertext>
        <aftertext><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</aftertext>
        <aftertext><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</aftertext>
        <aftertext><strong>Unrestricted Solicitations.</strong>  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>
          <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>

        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the <cite doc="Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and By-laws" path="containers|Constitution">Amended Constitution and Bylaws</cite> of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the LCOHA is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The LCOHA is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="PRP|PRP.7">Chapter PRP.7</cite>. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCOHA, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="PAP|PAP.4|PAP.4.12">Subchapter PAP.4.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on LCOHA operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <text>The LCOHA is exempted from the federal and state offered definition of an employer as provided by the American's with Disabilities Act, 42 USC § 12111 (5) (B).  However, as a matter of its own internal policies the Tribe discourages discrimination against persons with disabilities and when possible seeks to accommodate persons with disabilities on the job. When possible, the LCOHA will make reasonable efforts to provide reasonable accommodations to all employees and applicants, including work site accessibility. Employees must notify their department head or director or the LCOHA Human Resource Director, or designee, in writing of any requested reasonable accommodation within a reasonable period of time after the employee learns of the need for such accommodation.</text>

        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <text>Employees are not permitted to engage in nepotism, favoritism, and any outside business transactions, or other activities, which are detrimental to the best interests of the Tribe and/or the LCOHA. This includes activities that, directly or indirectly, divert business opportunities from the Tribe/LCOHA or confer an unfair advantage upon or benefit to a family member. It also includes activities that negatively reflect upon the Tribe/LCOHA's image or are contrary to the mission of the Tribe/LCOHA, except for activities specifically protected by law. The Tribe/LCOHA respects the right of employees to engage in activities outside their employment that are of a private nature and unrelated to their job or the Tribe/LCOHA. However, employees must fully disclose to their department head or director or the Human Resource Director, or designee, all business and personal activities that represent such a conflict of interest with the Tribe/LCOHA. If an employee is unsure whether a conflict of interest exists, the employee is encouraged to seek the advice of the Human Resource Director, or designee.</text>

In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the LCOHA and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the LCOHA supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>If you have a work related or personal problem that you think the LCOHA can help you resolve, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor. Your supervisor is usually in the best position to help you.</text>

            <num>(2)</num>
            <text>If you do not get an answer, or you are not satisfied with the answer, the issue should be written down and presented to the Human Resources Director.  The Human Resources Director will facilitate a meeting to assist with mutually resolving the issue.</text>

          <text><u>Open Communication Policy</u>. The LCOHA supports open lines of communication between employees, which assures all LCOHA employees concerns will be heard and considered. It is the belief and commitment of the LCOHA to maintain direct lines of communication and good working relationships with all employees. Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

        <text>Each employee shall agree to, by signing, a Consent to Appeal Procedure as a condition of continued employment. The Appeals Procedure constitutes a contract between the Tribe/LCOHA and the employee and establishes the framework under which employees may appeal disciplinary action imposed under <cite path="PAP|PAP.4|PAP.4.12">this subchapter</cite> or employment claims, provided no employee can appeal any disciplinary action based on activity that results in an arrest and conviction. In addition, regarding employment claims, it is important to note that nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe/LCOHA consenting to application of any law or waiving applicable defenses, including the defense that the subject law does not apply to the Tribe/LCOHA.</text>

        <text>The LCO-CHC is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="III|5">Title III, Chapter 5</cite> of the LCOTCL – Community Health Center Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to <cite path="TCT|TCT.1">Chapter TCT.1</cite> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCO-CHC, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="PAP|PAP.5|PAP.5.12">Subchapter PAP.5.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <text>It is the general policy of the LCO-CHC to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the LCO-CHC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <text>Employees are not permitted to engage in nepotism, favoritism, and any outside business transactions, or other activities, which are detrimental to the best interests of the LCO-CHC. This includes activities that, directly or indirectly, divert business opportunities from the LCO-CHC or confer an unfair advantage upon or benefit to a family member. It also includes activities that negatively reflect upon the LCO-CHC's image or are contrary to the mission of the LCO-CHC, except for activities specifically protected by law. The LCO-CHC respects the right of employees to engage in activities outside their employment that are of a private nature and unrelated to their job or the LCO-CHC. However, employees must fully disclose to their department head or director or the Human Resource Director, or designee, all business and personal activities that represent such a conflict of interest with the LCO-CHC. If an employee is unsure whether a conflict of interest exists, the employee is encouraged to seek the advice of the Human Resource Director, or designee.</text>

        <text>All employees and applicants for employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing, including reasonable suspicion, pre-employment, and return-to-duty. Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Health Director, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</text>

        <text>Employees shall not engage in off-duty misconduct which is deemed detrimental to the LCO-CHC. While it is impossible to predict every detrimental situation, the LCO-CHC may determine that off-duty misconduct is adverse to the LCO-CHC, because it is serious in nature; is at odds with an employee's job duties; or is notorious and has the potential to discredit the LCO-CHC. Any arrest shall be reported to the employee supervisor and the Human Resource department within 72 hours.  Any arrest shall be subject to review by the department director, and may include discipline including a suspension or termination depending on the determination and severity of the allegations leading to an arrest. An arrest and conviction related to misconduct shall be subject to discipline which may include termination.</text>

        <text>The presence of children in the workplace is discouraged because it can be disruptive to other employees. However, the LCO-CHC recognizes that there may be circumstances when it is necessary for an employee to have a child at the workplace for a short period. A supervisor has the authority to prohibit an employee from having a child at the workplace if the supervisor determines that the employee is abusing this policy or the workplace is being disturbed.</text>

          <text>While the LCO-CHC encourages its employees to enjoy and make good use of their off-duty time, certain activities on the part of employees may become a concern if they have the effect of impairing the work of any employee; harassing, demeaning, or creating a hostile working environment for any employee; disrupting the smooth and orderly flow of work within the office; or harming the goodwill and reputation of the LCO-CHC. In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the LCO-CHC and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the LCO-CHC supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>If you have a work related or personal problem that you think the LCO-CHC can help you resolve, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor. Your supervisor is usually in the best position to help you.</text>

            <num>(2)</num>
            <text>If you do not get an answer, or you are not satisfied with the answer, the issue should be written down and presented to the Human Resources Director.  The Human Resources Director will facilitate a meeting to assist with mutually resolving the issue.</text>

          <para>
            <num>(3)</num>
            <text>In the unlikely situation that these steps have not resolved the issue, you may take your problem to the Health Director.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(b)</num>
          <text><u>Chain of Command</u>. All employees are required to follow the chain of command, with no exceptions. The chain of command consists of and is limited to the following:</text>

          <text><u>Open Communication Policy</u>. The LCO-CHC supports open lines of communication between employees, which assures all employees concerns will be heard and considered. It is the belief and commitment of the LCO-CHC to maintain direct lines of communication and good working relationships with all employees. Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

        <text>Each employee shall agree to, by signing, a Consent to Appeal Procedure as a condition of continued employment. The Appeals Procedure constitutes a contract between the LCO-CHC and the employee and establishes the framework under which employees may appeal disciplinary action imposed under <cite path="PAP|PAP.5|PAP.5.12">this subchapter</cite> or employment claims, provided no employee can appeal any disciplinary action based on activity that results in an arrest and conviction. In addition, regarding employment claims, it is important to note that nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC consenting to application of any law or waiving applicable defenses, including the defense that the subject law does not apply to the LCO-CHC.</text>

The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The School is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="VII|7">7 LCOTCL Chapter 7</cite>. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the School, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="PAP|PAP.7|PAP.7.12">Subchapter PAP.7.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the School to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on School operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <text>Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the effective operation of the School.  Employees must report to work on time. Any employee who will be absent from work must notify the office manager in the administration office (for LCO School mainstream track employees) or the administrative assistant (for Waadookodaading immersion track employees), no later than sixty (60) minutes prior to their respective scheduled start time for instructional staff, and no later than thirty (30) minutes prior to their respective scheduled start time for non-instructional staff. If an employee cannot speak with the office manager in the administration office (for LCO School mainstream track employees) or the administrative assistant (for Waadookodaading immersion track employees), it is the employee's responsibility to speak with their department head or director. All employees must sign-in upon arrival if they arrive after their respective scheduled start time. Any employee who leaves campus for any reason must have prior approval from his or her department head or director, sign out and sign in upon return. Repeated instances of failure to report, regardless of the duration will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Failure to report to work, without notice, for three consecutive working days will be considered job abandonment and the employee will be considered to have resigned from the School. Job abandonment will not be subject to any appeal provisions and shall be subject to the provisions of <cite path="|PAP.7.5.080">Section PAP.7.5.080</cite> of this manual.</text>

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the School Director, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</text>

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the School and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the School supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>

            <text>If you do not get an answer, or you are not satisfied with the answer, the issue should be written down and presented to the Human Resources Director.  The Human Resources Director will facilitate a meeting to assist with mutually resolving the issue.</text>

          <text><u>Open Communication Policy</u>. The School supports open lines of communication between employees, which assures all employees concerns will be heard and considered. It is the belief and commitment of the School to maintain direct lines of communication and good working relationships with all employees. Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

        <text>Each employee shall agree to, by signing, a Consent to Appeal Procedure as a condition of continued employment. The Appeals Procedure constitutes a contract between the School and the employee and establishes the framework under which employees may appeal disciplinary action imposed under <cite path="PAP|PAP.7|PAP.7.12">this subchapter</cite> or employment claims, provided no employee can appeal any disciplinary action based on activity that results in an arrest and conviction. In addition, regarding employment claims, it is important to note that nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the School consenting to application of any law or waiving applicable defenses, including the defense that the subject law does not apply to the School.</text>

For example, if a payroll clerk attends a one-day Conference to learn accounting software, and the Conference lasts ten (9) hours, and has a one (1) hour lunch, the employee has nine (9) hours work time.</text>
          <para>

            <text>The training is directly related to the employee's job if it is designed to make the employee handle his job more effectively as distinguished from training him for another job, or to a new or additional skill.  For example, a stenographer who is given a course in stenography is engaged in an activity to make her a better stenographer. Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular work.</text>

            <num>(4)</num>
            <text>There are some special situations where the time spent in attending lectures, training sessions and courses of instruction is not regarded as hours worked. For example, an employer may establish for the benefit of his employees a program of instruction that corresponds to courses offered by independent bona fide institutions of learning. Voluntary attendance by an employee at such courses outside of working hours would not be hours worked even if they are directly related to his job, or paid for by the employer.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The Gaming Enterprises are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tribe established pursuant to <cite path="CMP|CMP.1">Chapter CMP.1</cite> of the LCOTCL – Gaming Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to <cite path="TCT|TCT.1">Chapter TCT.1</cite> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the Gaming Enterprises, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="PAP|PAP.9|PAP.9.12">Subchapter PAP.9.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Gaming Enterprises to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Gaming Enterprises looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Gaming Enterprises' consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

During a team member's probationary period they will get to know fellow team members, Management, and the duties involved for the position.

          <text>Group Health Insurance is through the Federal Employee Health Benefits; FEHB. An eligible employee may select an insurance provider that best meets their individual needs through FEHB. FEHB is offered for both single, single plus one, and family coverage. Upon completion of their introductory period, team members considered to be regular full-time and regular part-time status will be required to pay 21%, or as amended from time to time by official action of the Tribal Governing Board, of the premium for the plan selected, unless otherwise provided for in an Employment Contract with the Gaming Enterprises. Employee's portion of payment will be made through payroll deductions done weekly. Team members can request more information including Summary Plan Descriptions from the Human Resource Department.</text>

          <text>Team members who are covered by the group health plan may have the right to choose continuation of health coverage if coverage is lost due to a reduction in hours of employment or termination of employment. Continuation coverage is provided pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, and later amendments, otherwise known as "COBRA". Team members should contact the Human Resource Director for additional information regarding qualifying events or other requirements of COBRA.</text>

          <text><u>Requesting Personal Time Off Leave</u>. An essential function in the success of PTO is to ensure team members are given time off to use for vacation and other personal matters. PTO schedules will be determined on a first come first served basis. Prior to the utilization of accrued PTO, team members must schedule and have the use of accrued PTO time approved so it will not interfere with job responsibilities, except as otherwise provided by law. If a team member is on PTO and there is early release or closure of the team member's worksite, the team member shall be credited any such leave during the period of early release or closure. If requesting more than three (3) days of PTO time team members shall obtain prior authorization at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the leave date. The Director/Manager may or may not approve such request depending on a variety of factors, including schedules. In extreme emergency situations the Director/Manager, in consultation with an Executive Team Member, may waive the forty-eight (48) hours notification provision, if requested by the team member in writing citing the reason.</text>

          <text>Team members can take up to twelve (12) weeks of leave under this policy during any twelve (12) month period. The Gaming Enterprises will measure the twelve (12) month period as a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date a team member uses any leave under this policy. Each time a team member takes a leave, the Gaming Enterprises will compute the amount of leave you have taken under this policy and subtract it from the twelve (12) weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount a team member is entitled to take at that time. An employee's family or medical leave taken may run concurrently with other types of leave including workers' compensation and other leaves, such as short-term or long-term disability, etc. If a team member is not released to return to work within the allowable twelve (12) weeks in a rolling twelve (12) month period, the team member will be released from their employment with the Gaming Enterprises. The team member's release from employment shall be classified as being in good standing and they would be eligible for rehire with the gaming enterprises without the six (6) month wait for rehire.

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Gaming Enterprises recognizes that Team Members may develop personal, psychological, and medical problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Gaming Enterprises offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all team members and may schedule an appointment with the Human Resource Manager, or designee during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility, the team member may use unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP provides referrals to local community treatment sources and all visits are held in confidence.  EAP appointments will be coordinated with the team member's supervisor, using the chain-in-command policy, so customer service does not get interrupted. Participation in EAP does not excuse team members from complying with the provisions of this ordinance or from meeting normal job requirements during or after receiving assistance.  Nor will participation in our EAP prevent the Gaming Enterprises from taking disciplinary action against any team member for performance problems that occur before or after the team member's seeking assistance through the program. Team Members interested in learning more about EAP are encouraged to contact the Human Resources Director or designee.</text>

This includes activities that, directly or indirectly, divert business opportunities from the Gaming Enterprises or confer an unfair advantage upon or benefit to a family member. It also includes activities that negatively reflect upon the Gaming Enterprises' image or are contrary to the mission of the Gaming Enterprises, except for activities specifically protected by law. The Gaming Enterprises respects the right of team members to engage in activities outside their employment that are of a private nature and unrelated to their job or the Gaming Enterprises. However, team members must fully disclose to their Director/Manager or the Human Resource Director, or designee, all business and personal activities that represent such a conflict of interest with the Gaming Enterprises. If an employee is unsure whether a conflict of interest exists, the employee is encouraged to seek the advice of the Human Resource Director, or designee.</text>

Permission may be denied if the other employer is a competitor or supplier of the Gaming Enterprises.

The Gaming Enterprises considers all full time team members' work with the Gaming Enterprises to be their primary employment responsibility. As such, outside employment will not be considered an excuse for poor performance, absenteeism, tardiness or refusal/inability to work overtime.</text>

        <heading>Visiting While Not on Duty</heading>
        <text>There are times when a team member is off duty but still may need to be on the premises; for example, to pick up a payroll check, accompanying friends or relatives to our property, or reporting to and leaving a scheduled shift.  Team members should remember that when they are on the casino's property, they are still perceived by guests and co-workers to be a team member of the casino and, as such, are encouraged to conduct themselves in a business-like manner at all times. Team member appearance and demeanor are important to the perception of the employer by guests and throughout the general community.</text>

In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), team members may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding a team member's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

        <text>The Gaming Enterprises' "work environment" is considered to be all facilities, including any and all customer facilities and job sites, and any location where a team member represents the Gaming Enterprises, including travel on behalf of the employer and in circumstances where the team member is being reimbursed for expenses. While the employer has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its team members, it does expect team members to report for work in a condition to fully perform their duties and to refrain from the use of illegal drugs, the abuse of alcohol, and/or the abuse of prescribed medication while on duty.</text>

          <text>Being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication in the team member's work environment is normally just-cause for the team member to be referred for alcohol and drug testing. However, being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication does not excuse a team member's misconduct that violates any of the employer's rules, policies, procedures, or regulations. For example, an assault committed while subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication will subject the team member to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, because of the misconduct.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>All team members are expected to familiarize themselves with the employer's Policy for a Drug-Free Workplace. Team members are required to acknowledge their agreement to the policy by signing the acknowledgment form and returning the form to the Human Resource Department.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(b)</num>
          <text>Team members who have an alcohol, illegal drug, and/or prescribed medication problem may ask their immediate supervisor/manager for help. The supervisor/manager must immediately consult with the Human Resource Manager, or designee. The team member also has the option to go directly to the Human Resource Manager, or designee for help. This request for assistance may not be used as a means of avoiding disciplinary action if the team member has violated the employer Drug-Free Workplace Policy or any other such policy. Extreme care will be taken to maintain the requesting team member's privacy. A team member's decision to enter an Employee Assistance Program is considered voluntary when the team member enters the EAP before a referral by an appropriate medical official or a drug test that subsequently tests positive. The confidentiality of individuals using the EAP is to be protected within the limits of the law, consistent with safety and security concerns.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(c)</num>
          <text>It is the responsibility of each team member to voluntarily seek assistance from the Employee Assistance Program, or provider of choice, before the team member's alcohol, illegal drug, or prescribed medication abuse problem leads to disciplinary action. Disciplinary action for a violation of departmental policies and procedures or the provisions of this ordinance will not be lessened because a team member joins the Employee Assistance Program.</text>

        <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <text>The LCO Development Corporation recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The LCO Development Corporation offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO Clinic during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Superintendent, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace.

        <text>The presence of children in the workplace is discouraged because it can be disruptive to other employees. However, the LCO Development Corporation recognizes that there may be circumstances when it is necessary for an employee to have a child at the workplace for a short period. Management has the authority to prohibit an employee from having a child at the workplace if the supervisor determines that the employee is abusing this policy or the workplace is being disturbed. There will be no children allowed on job sites.</text>

In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

      <strong>Preamble</strong>
    </text>
    <text>The Lac Courte Oreilles Kinship Care and Long-Term Kinship Care Program is managed by the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Child Welfare Program to help support a child who lives outside of his or her home with a relative.

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Pursuant to Article XIV, Sec. A., the BFGC is an instrumentality of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and consistent with Article IV, is entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the Tribe, except as provided in Article XIV. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the BFGC unless the BFGC Board of Directors consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, constitutes a waiver of the BFGC's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

Another aspect of BFGC's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable to the operations of the BFGC without the express written permission of the Big Fish Golf Corp. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <text>The BFGC carries insurance to cover the cost of work-incurred injury or illness.  Benefits help pay for employees' medical treatment and a portion of any income lost while recovering.  If an employee is injured or becomes ill as a result of his/her job, it is the employee's responsibility to immediately notify a supervisor of their injury in order to receive benefits. Report every illness or injury to a supervisor, regardless of how minor it appears. Management will advise the employee of the procedure for submitting a workers' compensation claim. If necessary, injured employees will be referred to a medical care facility. Failure to report a work-related illness or injury promptly could result in a denial of benefits. An employee's report should contain as many details as possible, including the date, time, description of the illness or injury , and the names of any witnesses.</text>

        <text>It is recognized that not all Officers perform the same. This is positive to the Trainee in the effect that he/she may utilize Officers' experiences in a given field as well as the different avenues to handle the same or similar situation. There can be a negative side effect to this however, in that there can be no conformity to assist the Trainee in learning quicker. Typically, since these Officers have not received training in the Field Training Program, they may not fully understand the scoring, policy, or principles that encompass it.</text>
        <text>As such, when a Trainee is assigned with a Non-FTO Officer for exposure or assistance in a training task, the Field Training Officer shall put together a "Training Task Worksheet". This form would clearly state what goals the Field Training Officer would like covered (i.e. practice in vehicle stops, radar, accident investigation, etc.). The Non-FTO Officer would be asked to evaluate the Trainee's performance in the Training Task given as well as a performance (positive or negative) that was observed during the course of the shift. The evaluation would be given on a <u>Non-FTO Daily Observation Form</u> and handed back to the Field training Officer.

          <text>A Trainee may be removed from the Program is he/she fails to successfully complete the program by attaining repeated unsatisfactory ratings, failure to respond to training, or violating the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Police Department Departmental Policy and Procedure. The purpose of the Field Training Program is to train new employees so that they may successfully function as a Patrol Officer on their own. Unfortunately, this level of competency is not always attained. It may be that the Trainee realized their own expectations of working Patrol were not met, as they progressed through the Field Training Program and that the goals they had set for themselves were unattainable. Some Trainees may have been able to perform many, but not all of the tasks associated with patrol duties. Still others may have been able to perform competently in the required tasks, but their attitude or behavior did not match with the standards set by the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Police Department. Regardless of the cause(s), the fact that in some instances, the Trainee does not meet the requirements set by the Program.</text>

          <text>A Trainee's removal from the Program may not only be obligatory, but also necessary. In the event that the Trainee is not progressing in the Program and that it has been determined that attaining a satisfactory level of competence is not possible, removal from the program may be the next logical step. There are times when the Field Training Officer may go to great lengths to assist the Trainee in completing the Program. Although this is laudable, it is not always the greater interest of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Police Department. The Administration must be realistic to those employees that do not meet the exceptions of the Program. Retention of such employees not only presents a cause for liability but also for public image, money and safety factors.</text>

          <text><u>Daily Observation Report</u> - shall be completed on each day that the Trainee is scheduled to work with a Field Training Officer. In the event that multiple Field Training Officers are used, then copies of all prior Trainee <u>Daily Observation Reports</u> shall be made available to each subsequent Field Training Officer. The front side of the form lists thirty-two (32) category titles, which encompass a wide variety of Patrol Officer functions. The Field Training Officer shall assign a score based on Trainee performance to each category at the end of the duty shift. If multiple instances of the same category are observed, then the performance with the lesser rating shall be used for the end of the day result. Scoring of the <u>Daily Observation Report</u> shall be based on a sliding numeral value of "1" to "5", with "1" (Unacceptable) being the lowest possible score and "5" (Superior) the highest successful score. The criteria set for‒the numeral values of "1", "3" and "5" are laid forth in the <u>Standardized Scoring Guideline Handout</u>. The scores of "2", and "4" are discretionary values which may be used by the Field Training Officer, based on the amount of input needed by the Field Training Officer or the receptiveness of the Trainee to the task that receives a rating of "3" (Acceptable). The purpose of scoring is to assist in tracking what areas the Trainee needs improvement in as well as what areas the Trainee is achieving a consistent score in, denoting capable performance.</text>

            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>Scoring shall be placed on each category as a whole shift performance, rather than in each instance. For example: The Trainee responds to a building alarm three times in one shift. Performance in the first two is acceptable. Yet on the third call, the Trainee makes an Officer safety error which results in an unacceptable rating. At the end of the shift when scores for each category are compiled, the lesser of the three performance ratings is used.</text>

All categories that receive a rating of "2" (Minimally) or below must have a brief narrative as to why the performance was scored this way. In addition, if a category was scored a "1" (Unacceptable), some type of remedial training "R/T" shall be provided and such type of training shall be noted along with the time used to conduct the training. The type of remedial training used will be dependent on the situation, if the cause for the unacceptable score can be addressed through demonstration or discussion then the Field Training Officer need only briefly document what was provided to the Trainee and the approximate length of time used. The training time or "T/T" marking should appear on the front of the form next to the category in which the remedial training was used.</text>

For such an event the Field Training Supervisor and the Field Training Officer should prepare detailed training tasks for the Trainee to complete. The task is developed based on the categories where the Trainee needs improvement in. The training task shall be issued to the Trainee and the Trainee's performance rated on a <u>Training Task Worksheet Form</u>. This form shall be used throughout the program.</text>

        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the LCO Day Care is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.</text>

        <text>The LCO Day Care is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCO Day Care unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <text>It is the general policy of the LCO Day Care to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on LCO Day Care operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <heading>Employee Assistance Program</heading>
        <text>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise, the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor, so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <heading>Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures</heading>
        <text>All employees and applicants for employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing, including reasonable suspicion, pre-employment, return-to-duty. Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the LCO Day Care Director, Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the LCO Day Care Director, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the LCO Day Care Director, Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be subject to immediate dismissal.</text>

          <text>While the LCO Day Care encourages its employees to enjoy and make good use of their off-duty time, certain activities on the part of employees may become a concern if they have the effect of impairing the work of any employee; harassing, demeaning, or creating a hostile working environment for any employee; disrupting the smooth and orderly flow of work within the office; or harming the goodwill and reputation of the LCO Day Care. In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Myspace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above.

The decision shall be provided to each party by first-class mail to the person's last known address; electronic mail to the party and to the party's attorney or lay advocate who has filed a notice of appearance in the action; or by delivery to such person, the person's home, or the person's office.</text>
